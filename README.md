### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced computational biologist with eight years of post-PhD experience specializing in high-dimensional statistical and machine learning analysis, software and methods development, molecular modeling, molecular dynamics simulation, and bioinformatics. Proficient in several programming languages, software tools, data science packages, website development, and high-performance computing.

My most recent research revolved around statistical and machine learning-based analysis of flow and mass cytometry and SomaScan data in the human immunology domain.

I have a long-standing passion for [photography](https://unsplash.com/@rohitfarmer) that spans from macro to portraits to the landscape. I [read](https://www.goodreads.com/rohitfarmer) often, and sometimes I [write](https://medium.com/@rohitfarmer). I recently got my Ham radio liscence with the call sign [KC3SNU](https://www.qrz.com/db/kc3snu). You can find more about me on my website https://rohitfarmer.com.
